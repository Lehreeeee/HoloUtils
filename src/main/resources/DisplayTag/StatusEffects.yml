# This is for showing status effect on mobs
# Please use MiniMessage format for the tag, link -> https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html

# IMPORTANT #
# For modeled entities, you must add an empty bone named "p_statuseffect" and display will be mounted on it.
# In case you don't know, a bone is a folder(Group) in Blockbench, just create an empty folder(Group) WITHOUT any cube inside and place them
# where u would like the display to be mounted. Don't worry, it is possible to edit with a simple reload if it wrongly setup.
# @Lehreeeee if you need further help.

# Height of the title (duh), 0.6 for mobs.
status-height: 0.6

# /holoutils statusdisplay [UUID] [Status] [Duration_in_ticks]
