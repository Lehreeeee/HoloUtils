## IMPORTANT ##
# 1. recurrency{} works, but in a janky way due to their API being unusable.
#    - It relies on the placeholder "%reconomy-mileage_balance_no_commas%" to check balance.
#    - Then, it runs a console command: "/recurrency remove Lehreeeee 0.005 mileage" to deduct balance.
#    - @Lehreeeee if their placeholders or commands changed, adjustments will be needed.
#
# 2. Entry names (e.g., "WAH", "1") don't matter, just don't repeat.
#
# 3. More customization options will be added when im free.
